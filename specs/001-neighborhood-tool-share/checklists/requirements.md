# Specification Quality Checklist: Abbington Neighborhood Tool Share

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- Specification avoids technical implementation details
- Focus remains on what users need and why
- Language is accessible to non-technical neighbors
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all decisions made with reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions)
- All 13 functional requirements are clear and testable
- 6 success criteria defined with specific metrics (time, percentages, screen sizes)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "signup in under 3 minutes" not "API response time")
- 4 user stories with comprehensive acceptance scenarios (18 total scenarios)
- 8 edge cases identified for future consideration
- Scope bounded to tool listing/browsing/adding (excludes borrowing workflow)
- Assumptions section documents 9 key assumptions

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories cover all primary flows: browse/search (US1), signup (US2), add tools (US3), AI assist (US4)
- Measurable outcomes align with user stories
- No technology choices specified (no mention of databases, frameworks, hosting)

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. All quality checks passed.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization (P1 for core features, P2 for AI enhancement)
- Independently testable user stories
- Comprehensive edge case identification
- Well-documented assumptions reduce ambiguity without requiring clarification
