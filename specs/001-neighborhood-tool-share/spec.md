# Feature Specification: Abbington Neighborhood Tool Share

**Feature Branch**: `001-neighborhood-tool-share`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application used for tool sharing for our neighborhood, Abbington. The features are: Users should login to the site using Facebook authentication. Our neighborhood uses a Facebook private group for chat so we want to stay integrated with the Facebook experience as much as is reasonable. Sign up on the site should ask the user to (1) confirm they understand the tool share rules around returning items in good condition and (2) prompt them for their Name, address, and mobile number (to be able to text). Users should be able to add tools they own. As a P2 feature, users should be able to take a picture of their tool, with model number visible, and have AI look up the info for it, as a a shortcut. Users should be see all the tools listed and search for what they want. The site should be both mobile and desktop friendly"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse and Search Available Tools (Priority: P1)

A neighbor wants to find a specific tool (e.g., a pressure washer) that they need for a weekend project. They open the tool share site on their phone, search for "pressure washer", and can immediately see what's available in the neighborhood along with who owns it.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the tool share - enabling neighbors to discover what tools are available before considering purchasing or renting. Without this, the platform provides no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding sample tools to the system and verifying search/browse functionality returns expected results. Delivers immediate value by showing what's available in the neighborhood.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the tool share has 20 tools listed, **When** a logged-in user visits the home page, **Then** they see all tools displayed with basic info (name, owner, photo if available)
2. **Given** an unauthenticated user visits the site, **When** they try to view the tool list, **Then** they are redirected to the login page
3. **Given** a logged-in user is viewing the tool list, **When** they type "drill" in the search box, **Then** only tools with "drill" in the name or description are shown
4. **Given** a logged-in user is browsing on a mobile phone, **When** they scroll through the tool list, **Then** the layout adapts to the smaller screen and all content remains readable and interactive
5. **Given** a logged-in user is browsing on a desktop, **When** they view the tool list, **Then** the layout uses the available screen space efficiently

### User Story 2 - First-Time Registration and Agreement (Priority: P1)

A new neighbor discovers the tool share site through the Abbington Facebook group. They click the "Sign in with Facebook" button, review the tool share rules (return items in good condition, respect borrowing times, etc.), agree to the terms, and provide their name, address within Abbington, and mobile number so other neighbors can contact them about borrowing.

**Why this priority**: Authentication and user profiles are foundational - without knowing who users are and how to contact them, no borrowing can happen. This is blocking for all other features.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by going through the signup flow as a new Facebook user and verifying profile data is collected and stored. Delivers value by establishing trusted user identities.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user visits the site, **When** they click "Sign in with Facebook", **Then** they are redirected to Facebook for authentication
2. **Given** a user has authenticated with Facebook but not completed signup, **When** they return to the site, **Then** they see the signup form requesting agreement to rules and profile information
3. **Given** a user is completing signup, **When** they try to proceed without checking the "I agree to tool share rules" checkbox, **Then** they see an error message and cannot proceed
4. **Given** a user is completing signup, **When** they submit their name, address, and mobile number, **Then** their profile is created and they can access the full site
5. **Given** a user has completed signup previously, **When** they sign in with Facebook again, **Then** they are logged in directly without seeing the signup form again

### User Story 3 - Add Tools to Share (Priority: P1)

A neighbor has a collection of power tools they're willing to share with the neighborhood. They log into the tool share site, click "Add Tool", and fill in details like the tool name, description, and optionally upload a photo. The tool now appears in the neighborhood's tool list for others to discover.

**Why this priority**: Without tools listed in the system, there's nothing to browse or borrow. This is essential for populating the tool inventory.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in as a user and adding several tools with different attributes (with/without photos, different descriptions). Verify tools appear in the browse/search results. Delivers value by building the shared tool inventory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a logged-in user clicks "Add Tool", **When** they fill in the tool name and description, **Then** they can save the tool even without a photo
2. **Given** a user is adding a tool, **When** they upload a photo, **Then** the photo is saved and displayed with the tool listing
3. **Given** a user has added a tool, **When** they view the tool list, **Then** their tool appears alongside tools from other users
4. **Given** a user is adding a tool on mobile, **When** they use the form, **Then** the interface is optimized for touch input and small screens
5. **Given** a user owns a tool in the system, **When** they view their tool, **Then** they can see it's attributed to them

### User Story 4 - AI-Assisted Tool Entry via Photo (Priority: P2)

A neighbor has a complex power tool (like a Milwaukee cordless drill) and wants to add it to the tool share without manually typing all the specifications. They take a photo that clearly shows the model number on the tool, upload it through the "Add Tool" feature, and the system automatically fills in the tool name, brand, and description based on what it recognizes from the photo.

**Why this priority**: This is a convenience feature that reduces friction in adding tools, but the core functionality (manual tool entry) works without it. It's a nice-to-have that improves user experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by uploading photos of various tools with visible model numbers and verifying the auto-populated information is accurate. Works independently of other features beyond basic tool addition.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is adding a tool, **When** they select "Use AI to identify tool" and upload a photo with a visible model number, **Then** the system attempts to extract and populate tool details
2. **Given** the AI successfully identifies a tool, **When** the results are shown to the user, **Then** the user can review and edit the auto-populated fields before saving
3. **Given** the AI cannot identify a tool from the photo, **When** the process completes, **Then** the user sees a message explaining the limitation and can proceed with manual entry
4. **Given** a user uploads a photo without a visible model number, **When** the AI processes it, **Then** the user receives guidance on what makes a good photo for identification

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to sign in with Facebook but their account is not in the Abbington neighborhood Facebook group? (Do we validate membership, or trust anyone who signs up?)
- How does the system handle duplicate tool entries (e.g., three neighbors all list "Ryobi cordless drill")?
- What happens if a user uploads an offensive or inappropriate tool photo?
- What happens if a user enters an invalid phone number format during signup or profile update?
- What happens if a user tries to edit or delete another user's tool?

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a member of the Abbington neighborhood. Attributes include Facebook user ID, full name, neighborhood address, mobile phone number, agreement timestamp to tool share rules, account creation date.

- **Tool**: Represents a physical tool available for sharing. Attributes include tool name, description, owner (relationship to User), photo, date added, current availability status.

- **Tool Share Rules**: The set of community guidelines users must agree to, including expectations around returning items in good condition, borrowing timeframes, and respectful communication.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: New users can complete the entire signup process (Facebook login, rule agreement, profile completion) in under 3 minutes
- **SC-002**: Users can find a specific tool using search in under 30 seconds
- **SC-003**: Users can add a new tool (without AI assistance) in under 2 minutes
- **SC-004**: The site remains fully functional and usable on screens ranging from 320px (mobile) to 1920px+ (desktop) wide
- **SC-005**: At least 80% of AI-assisted tool identifications (P2 feature) correctly populate tool name and brand when model numbers are clearly visible in photos
- **SC-006**: 90% of users successfully complete signup on their first attempt without errors or confusion

## Assumptions

- Users signing up are members of the Abbington neighborhood Facebook group, but membership is not programmatically verified
- Tool borrowing/lending logistics (requesting, approving, tracking returns) are handled outside the system via direct neighbor-to-neighbor communication (text, Facebook message)
- The tool share rules are static text provided by the neighborhood and don't require dynamic updates
- Users are responsible for removing or updating their tool listings if tools become unavailable
- Initial version supports English language only
- Phone number format follows US standards
- Facebook authentication provides reliable user identification sufficient for this community tool
- Photo storage requirements are modest (expect <100 tools initially, <500 long-term)
- AI tool identification (P2) will use an existing vision/OCR service rather than custom-built ML models
