**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - First-Time Registration and Agreement (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP Foundation

**Goal**: Enable Facebook authentication and user profile creation with agreement to tool share rules

**Why First**: Authentication is foundational - all other features require knowing who the user is. Without this, no one can access the system.

**Independent Test**: Go through signup flow as a new Facebook user, verify profile data is collected and stored, confirm user can access authenticated pages after signup.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T028 [P] [US2] Create SignInButton component with Facebook OAuth in components/auth/SignInButton.tsx
- [x] T029 [P] [US2] Create landing page in app/page.tsx with Facebook login button and tool share rules preview

**Checkpoint**: Users can sign in with Facebook, complete profile, and access authenticated pages

---

## Phase 4: User Story 1 - Browse and Search Available Tools (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP Core Value

**Goal**: Enable logged-in users to browse all tools and search by keywords

**Why Second**: This is the core value proposition - seeing what's available. Depends on authentication (US2) but delivers immediate value once implemented.

**Independent Test**: Add sample tools to database, log in as user, verify all tools display, test search filtering by typing keywords.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T037 [P] [US1] Create tools browse/search page in app/tools/page.tsx with server component for data fetching
- [ ] T038 [P] [US1] Create SearchBox client component in components/tools/SearchBox.tsx with debounced search

**Checkpoint**: Users can browse all tools in responsive grid and filter by search keywords

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Add Tools to Share (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP Tool Inventory

**Goal**: Enable users to add tools they own with name, description, and optional photo

**Why Third**: Without tools in the system, there's nothing to browse. This completes the core MVP loop: signup ‚Üí browse ‚Üí add tools.

**Independent Test**: Log in as user, add several tools with different attributes (with/without photos), verify tools appear in browse/search results.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T046 [P] [US3] Create add tool page in app/tools/add/page.tsx with auth check
- [ ] T047 [P] [US3] Create AddToolForm client component in components/tools/ToolForm.tsx with photo upload

- [ ] T063 [P] [US3] Create DeleteToolButton client component in components/tools/DeleteConfirm.tsx
- [ ] T064 [US3] Create deleteTool server action in lib/actions/tools.ts
- [ ] T065 [US3] Add confirmation dialog before deleting tool
- [ ] T066 [US3] Add photo cleanup from storage when tool is deleted

**Checkpoint**: Users can add, view, edit, and delete their own tools with photos

---

## Phase 6: User Profile Management (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP Profile Updates

**Goal**: Enable users to edit their profile information (name, address, phone) after signup

**Why Fourth**: Users need ability to update contact info. Completes the MVP feature set for launch.

**Independent Test**: Log in as existing user, update profile fields, verify changes persist and display correctly.

- [ ] T071 [US2] Add success message and redirect after profile update

**Checkpoint**: Users can edit all profile fields and changes are validated and saved

---

## Phase 7: User Story 4 - AI-Assisted Tool Entry via Photo (Priority: P2) üöÄ Enhanced UX

**Goal**: Enable users to upload a photo of a tool with visible model number and have AI auto-populate tool details

**Why P2**: This is a convenience feature that reduces friction but core functionality (manual entry) works without it.

**Independent Test**: Upload photos of various tools with visible model numbers, verify auto-populated information is accurate, test fallback when AI cannot identify.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T072 [P] [US4] Create AI tool identification API route in app/api/ai/identify-tool/route.ts
- [ ] T073 [P] [US4] Install OpenAI SDK dependency: openai

3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 2 - Authentication (T028-T036)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 1 - Browse Tools (T037-T045)
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 3 - Add Tools (T046-T066)
6. Complete Phase 6: Profile Management (T067-T071)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run quickstart.md manual tests for all MVP features
8. **Deploy MVP**: Core functionality ready for neighborhood use

### Post-MVP Enhancement

9. Complete Phase 7: User Story 4 - AI Tool Identification (T072-T082) - P2 feature
10. Complete Phase 8: Polish (T083-T099)
11. **Final Validation**: Full manual test cycle
12. **Production Deploy**: Complete system with all features

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phases 1-2): Project structure and database ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **MVP Increment 1** (Phase 3): Authentication ‚Üí Users can sign up
3. **MVP Increment 2** (Phase 4): Browse tools ‚Üí Users can see available tools (requires sample data)
4. **MVP Increment 3** (Phase 5): Add tools ‚Üí Users can list their tools
5. **MVP Increment 4** (Phase 6): Profile updates ‚Üí Users can update contact info
6. **üéØ MVP COMPLETE** - Ready for neighborhood launch
7. **Enhancement** (Phase 7): AI identification ‚Üí Easier tool entry
8. **Polish** (Phase 8): Production ready

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **Together**: Complete Setup (Phase 1) + Foundational (Phase 2)
2. **Sequential for MVP**: US2 (Auth) ‚Üí US1 (Browse) ‚Üí US3 (Add Tools) ‚Üí Profile
   - Auth must complete first (blocks others)
   - Browse and Add Tools could be parallel but share UI patterns, so sequential is cleaner
3. **Parallel post-MVP**:
   - Developer A: Phase 7 (AI feature)
   - Developer B: Phase 8 (Polish tasks)
